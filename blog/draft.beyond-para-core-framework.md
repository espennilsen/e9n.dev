I wrote previously about using Obsidian with the PARA method. Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Four folders for everything in your digital life. It works.

But PARA has a limitation. It tells you where to put information. It doesn't tell you what to do with it.

I'd organize notes beautifully into the right folders, then never look at them again. Information went in but rarely came out in useful ways. My system was tidy but inert.

The CORE framework changed that. Where PARA answers "where does this go?", CORE answers "what do I do with this?" Together, they transform a storage system into a thinking system.

## What Is CORE?

CORE stands for Capture, Organize, Review, Engage. It's a workflow developed by Jeff Su, who taught it to thousands of people at Google. The framework applies to four types of information: tasks, ideas, notes, and files.

The insight behind CORE is simple: information without action is just clutter. Every piece of information needs to flow through a process that ends with you actually using it.

**Capture** is about getting information out of your head and into a system quickly. No friction, no decisions about where it goes yet. Just capture.

**Organize** is about putting that information in the right place so you can find it later. This is where PARA fits in.

**Review** is the step most people skip. You systematically look at what you've captured and organized to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.

**Engage** is about taking action. Using the information to make decisions, complete tasks, or create something new.

PARA handles the Organize step well. But without Capture, Review, and Engage, organization becomes an end in itself rather than a means to doing better work.

## How CORE and PARA Work Together

Here's how I think about the relationship between the two frameworks:

**PARA** is the structure. It's the folders, the categories, the architecture of where things live.

**CORE** is the flow. It's how information moves through that structure and becomes useful.

You need both. Structure without flow gives you a well-organized graveyard. Flow without structure gives you chaos. Together, they create a system that's both organized and alive.

Let me walk through each step of CORE and how it connects to a PARA setup.

## Capture: Get It Out of Your Head

The first rule of capture is: make it effortless. If capturing something takes more than a few seconds, you won't do it consistently.

In my system, everything goes to the Inbox first. I don't think about which folder it belongs in. I don't worry about formatting. I just get it down.

**What I capture:**
- Tasks that come up during meetings or conversations
- Ideas that hit me randomly
- Notes from calls or things I read
- Links, files, screenshots I might need later

**How I capture:**
- Quick Add in Obsidian for things I'm at my desk
- Voice memos on my phone that I transcribe later
- Email to myself when nothing else is available
- A small notebook for situations where phones aren't appropriate

The key is having capture methods for every context. If you're in a meeting and something comes up, you need a way to capture it without disrupting the flow. If you're walking and have an idea, you need to get it down before it disappears.

The Inbox in PARA is the landing zone for all of this. Nothing gets organized during capture. That comes later.

## Organize: Put It Where It Belongs

Once something is captured, it needs to find its home. This is where PARA shines.

During processing (I do this once or twice daily), I go through my Inbox and ask one question for each item: "What is this related to?"

If it's related to an active project, it goes in that project folder. If it's an ongoing responsibility, it goes in the relevant Area. If it's reference material I might need later, it goes in Resources. If it's done or no longer relevant, it goes to Archive or gets deleted.

**The PARA decision tree:**
1. Is this actionable right now? → Project folder
2. Is this an ongoing responsibility? → Area folder
3. Is this useful reference material? → Resources folder
4. Is this done or inactive? → Archive or delete

Most items fall clearly into one category. For the ones that don't, I ask: "Where would I look for this when I need it?" That usually gives me the answer.

The goal of organizing isn't perfection. It's being able to find things when you need them. Good enough organization that you maintain beats perfect organization that you abandon.

## Review: The Step Everyone Skips

Here's where most systems fall apart. People capture and organize diligently, but they never review. Their notes become a write-only database.

Review is what makes information useful. It's how you stay on top of commitments, surface forgotten ideas, and maintain awareness of what's in your system.

**I do three types of review:**

**Daily processing.** Clear the Inbox. Check today's tasks. Scan active projects for anything urgent. This takes 10-15 minutes, usually at the end of the day.

**Weekly review.** Go through each active project. What's the status? What's the next action? Is anything stuck? Scan Areas for anything that needs attention. Move completed projects to Archive. This takes 20-30 minutes, usually Friday afternoon.

**Monthly review.** Zoom out further. Are my projects aligned with what matters? Are there Areas I'm neglecting? Is there anything in Resources I should revisit? Any projects that should be killed? This takes 30-45 minutes.

The weekly review is non-negotiable. Skip it for a few weeks and the system starts to rot. You lose track of commitments. Projects stall without you noticing. The Inbox overflows.

I've tried to skip reviews when things get busy. It always backfires. The 30 minutes I "save" costs hours of confusion and dropped balls later.

## Engage: Actually Use the Information

The point of all this isn't to have organized notes. It's to do better work. Engage is where that happens.

**Engage looks different depending on the information type:**

For tasks, engage means doing them. Blocking time, making the call, writing the email, completing the work.

For ideas, engage means developing them. Writing about them, discussing them, testing them, or deciding they're not worth pursuing.

For notes, engage means using them. Referencing meeting notes in follow-ups. Pulling from research when writing. Building on past thinking.

For files, engage means accessing them when needed. The proposal template you saved. The competitor analysis from last quarter. The documentation you bookmarked.

**How PARA supports engagement:**

When I start working on a project, everything I need is in one folder. Meeting notes, research, drafts, files. I'm not hunting across the system trying to piece things together.

When I'm preparing for a conversation about an ongoing Area, I can review my notes and see the history. What we discussed before. What was decided. What's still open.

When I'm writing or thinking about a topic, my Resources folder has the reference material I've collected. Articles, frameworks, examples, my own previous notes.

The structure serves the action. Organization is the preparation. Engagement is the payoff.

## A Day in the System

Let me make this concrete with an example of how CORE flows through a typical day.

**Morning.** I check my task list and calendar. I review my top project to remind myself what's active. I'm clear on what needs to happen today.

**During the day.** Things come up. A customer mentions a concern in a call. I capture it in my Inbox. A colleague sends a useful article. I capture the link. An idea hits me for a blog post. I capture a quick note. I don't stop to organize any of this. I just capture and keep moving.

**Late afternoon.** I process the Inbox. The customer concern goes into that deal's project folder with a task to follow up. The article goes into my AI Tools resource folder. The blog idea goes into my Blog project folder. Everything has a home now.

**End of day.** Quick review of tomorrow. What's the priority? What meetings do I have? Is there anything I need to prepare?

**Friday.** Weekly review. I go through each project, update status, identify stuck items. I scan Areas. I clean up anything that's accumulated. I move finished projects to Archive. I start next week with a clear picture.

This rhythm keeps the system alive. Capture continuously. Organize daily. Review weekly. Engage constantly.

## Common Mistakes

A few things I got wrong before landing on this approach:

**Organizing during capture.** This creates friction that kills the habit. Capture first, organize later. Always.

**Skipping reviews because you're busy.** The busier you are, the more you need reviews. They're how you stay in control when there's a lot going on.

**Treating organization as the goal.** A beautiful system you don't use is worthless. The goal is better work, not better folders.

**Making it too complicated.** PARA is four folders. CORE is four steps. Don't add complexity. Add complexity only when you feel specific friction, not preemptively.

**Not capturing enough.** When in doubt, capture it. Storage is cheap. The cost of losing an idea or forgetting a commitment is high.

## Why This Combination Works

PARA without CORE gives you organized archives you never visit. CORE without PARA gives you a workflow without a stable structure to support it.

Together, they create a system that's both reliable and dynamic. Information flows in through Capture. It finds its place through Organize (PARA). It stays relevant through Review. It becomes useful through Engage.

The system works because it mirrors how we actually use information. We encounter things randomly. We need to store them somewhere. We need to periodically step back and see the big picture. And ultimately, we need to act.

Most productivity systems fail because they optimize for one step at the expense of others. They're great at capture but weak on review. Or they're great at organization but don't help you actually use what you've organized.

CORE plus PARA optimizes the full cycle. That's why it works.

## Getting Started

If you already use PARA, adding CORE is straightforward:

1. **Audit your capture methods.** Can you capture quickly in every context? If not, fill the gaps.

2. **Establish a processing rhythm.** Daily Inbox clearing is the minimum. Put it on your calendar until it becomes automatic.

3. **Schedule your weekly review.** Friday afternoon works for most people. Protect this time. It's more important than most meetings.

4. **Connect organization to action.** When you file something, ask: "What will I do with this?" If the answer is nothing, maybe it doesn't need to be saved.

The frameworks are simple. The challenge is consistency. But once the rhythm is established, it becomes automatic. You stop thinking about the system and start benefiting from it.

That's the goal. A system that runs in the background, keeping you organized and on top of things, so you can focus on the work that matters.
