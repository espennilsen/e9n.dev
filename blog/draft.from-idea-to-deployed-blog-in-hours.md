I've been meaning to start a blog for years.

Not months. Years. I had ideas. I had things to say. I had opinions about AI, sales, career development, and the intersection of all three. What I didn't have was a blog.

The excuses were endless: I didn't know which platform to use. I wasn't sure about the design. I needed to figure out my "content strategy" first. I should probably learn more about SEO. Maybe I'd start next quarter when things calmed down.

Then one evening, I stopped making excuses and just built the thing. In a few hours, I went from nothing to a deployed site. Not perfect. Not polished. But live.

This post is about how I did that, but more importantly, it's about what I learned from finally taking the chance.

## The Fear That Keeps Us Stuck

Here's what was really stopping me: fear of looking stupid.

I'm a sales manager, not a developer. What if the site looked amateurish? What if my writing wasn't good enough? What if people in my industry saw it and thought less of me professionally? What if I put myself out there and nobody cared?

These fears feel rational when you're living inside them. They feel like prudent risk management. "I'll launch when I'm ready" sounds responsible.

But "ready" never comes. There's always another skill to learn, another improvement to make, another reason to wait. Perfectionism disguised as preparation is still just avoidance.

At some point, I realized: the cost of not starting was higher than the cost of starting imperfectly. Every week I delayed was a week of ideas unexpressed, connections unmade, learning not compounded.

So I gave myself permission to be imperfect and just began.

## The Build: One Evening's Work

Here's roughly how that evening went.

**Decision made.** I'd been going back and forth between platforms for months. Next.js? Too complex for a simple blog. WordPress? Too bloated. Ghost? Didn't want to pay for hosting. Medium? Wanted to own my content.

I landed on 11ty, a simple static site generator. Static sites are fast, basically free to host on GitHub Pages, and simple enough to actually finish. Decision made. Moving on.

**Scaffolding with AI.** I opened Claude Code and described what I wanted: a clean, minimal blog with a homepage, blog listing, individual posts, an about page, and a projects page. Dark theme. Simple navigation. Mobile responsive.

Claude generated the initial structure. Was it perfect? No. But it was a starting point I could actually see and modify. I could have spent days learning 11ty's conventions from documentation. Instead, I had a working scaffold in twenty minutes.

**Making it mine.** This is where human judgment matters. The AI-generated starting point was generic. I needed to make it feel like me.

I tweaked the colors and typography. I wrote the homepage copy: "Exploring the intersection of AI, Sales, and Self-Growth." I added my actual bio. I created placeholder content for the projects section.

None of this was complicated. But it required decisions that only I could make. What do I want this site to say about me? What's the vibe? What matters?

**Content and deployment.** I wrote my first real post, an introduction to who I am and what I'd be writing about. Not a masterpiece. Just honest.

Then I pushed it to GitHub, configured GitHub Pages, pointed my domain, and waited for DNS propagation.

And then it was live. e9n.dev existed. Not in my head, not in my plans, but actually on the internet, accessible to anyone.

**Total time: one evening.** From nothing to deployed.

## What Made This Possible

A few things came together:

**AI as a force multiplier.** Claude Code didn't build the blog for me. I still made all the decisions. But it collapsed the tedious parts: boilerplate code, config file syntax, CSS basics. It let me focus on what mattered (content, design choices, structure) instead of what didn't (remembering template syntax).

**Embracing "good enough."** I shipped with a minimal design. No fancy animations. No elaborate features. No comments section. No newsletter signup. Just the core: pages, posts, navigation. Everything else could come later.

**Time-boxing.** I gave myself one evening. Not "until it's perfect." One evening. That constraint forced decisions. When you have infinite time, every choice becomes agonizing. When you have a few hours, you pick something and move on.

**Building on prior knowledge.** Years of tinkering with technology meant I wasn't starting from zero. The long game investments I'd made over time paid off in this moment. I understood enough to direct the AI and troubleshoot when things went wrong.

## The Deeper Lesson: Show Your Work

There's a concept I've been thinking about: "working with the garage door open." The idea is that creators often hide their process, only revealing polished final products. But there's value in letting people see the work in progress.

This blog is me opening the garage door.

I'm not an expert writer. I'm not a professional developer. I'm a sales leader who's interested in AI and personal growth and building things. This site is me showing up, imperfectly, and sharing what I'm learning.

That's scary. It's vulnerable. And it's exactly why it matters.

Because here's what I've learned from sales: people connect with authenticity more than polish. The customer doesn't want a perfect pitch. They want to trust that you understand their problem. The colleague doesn't want a flawless presentation. They want to know you've actually thought about the issue.

The same is true for creative work. A real person sharing real ideas, even imperfectly, is more compelling than a polished facade with nothing behind it.

## The Compound Effects of Putting Yourself Out There

In the weeks since launching, small things have started to happen.

A former colleague reached out after seeing a post on LinkedIn. "I didn't know you were into AI. We should talk." A conversation started that wouldn't have happened otherwise.

I've clarified my own thinking by writing it down. Ideas that were fuzzy in my head became concrete on the page. Writing is thinking, and publishing is commitment to that thinking.

I've built something I can point to. When someone asks what I'm interested in outside of work, I can share a link. The blog is a tangible artifact of who I am and what I care about.

These are small returns. But they compound. Each post is a seed. Some will grow, most won't. But you can't harvest what you don't plant.

## What's Holding You Back?

If you've been meaning to start something, a blog, a side project, a creative pursuit, I want to ask you directly: what are you waiting for?

Is it the technical knowledge? AI tools have collapsed the barrier. You can scaffold almost anything in an evening.

Is it the time? You don't need much. An hour here, an hour there. Consistency beats intensity.

Is it the fear of judgment? Here's a secret: most people are too busy worrying about their own work to judge yours. And the ones who do judge? They're not your audience anyway.

Is it waiting until you're ready? You'll never feel ready. Readiness is a myth. You get ready by starting, not before.

## The Site Isn't Finished

I want to be clear: e9n.dev is not done. It's version 1.0. Maybe version 0.5, honestly.

There's no newsletter yet. No comments. The design could be better. The projects page is sparse. I don't have a content calendar. I'm not sure about the taxonomy of tags.

All of that is fine.

Because the site exists. It's live. I'm writing on it. I'm shipping posts. The flywheel is turning.

Iteration beats ideation. A live site you can improve is infinitely better than a perfect site that only exists in your head.

## Your Move

Here's my challenge to you:

Pick something you've been meaning to do. The blog you haven't started. The project you keep planning. The idea you haven't shared.

Give yourself a time box. An evening. A weekend. A week at most.

Build the simplest possible version. Not the vision in your head. The minimum that could actually exist.

Ship it. Put it into the world. Tell someone about it.

Then iterate. Make it better. But only after it exists.

The gap between "I'm going to" and "I did" is smaller than it feels. It's just a few hours of work and a willingness to be imperfect in public.

Take the chance. Show your work. Start before you're ready.

That's how things actually get built.

*What have you been putting off? I'm genuinely curious. And if you've recently shipped something you were nervous about, I'd love to hear how it went.*
