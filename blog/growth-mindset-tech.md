# The Day I Stopped Caring About AWS Outages

Last month, AWS went down during our product launch. Six months of work. Marketing campaign running. Demo scheduled with a Fortune 500 prospect in 2 hours.

I watched Slack explode. The CEO was pinging everyone. Engineering was scrambling. Sales was already drafting apology emails.

And I felt... fine?

<!--excerpt-->

## This Wasn't Always Me

Three years ago, I would've been the most stressed person in that room. Refreshing AWS status every 30 seconds. Drafting contingency plans. Catastrophizing about lost revenue.

But somewhere between then and now, I read Marcus Aurelius. And more importantly, I actually got what he was saying.

## The Dichotomy of Control (But Real)

AWS being down? Not in my control.

Our error handling when AWS comes back up? Completely in my control.

The prospect rescheduling? Not in my control.

How I communicate the situation to them? Completely in my control.

This sounds obvious when you read it. But actually internalizing it? That's different.

## What Changed

I started a practice: Every sprint planning, I ask "What here is actually in our control?"

Product wants a feature that requires third-party API that doesn't exist yet? Out of our control. Can we control the fallback experience? Yes.

Leadership wants faster delivery? We can't control their expectations. Can we control our communication about realistic timelines? Yes.

## The Paradox

Here's what's weird: Caring less about the uncontrollable made me better at my job.

When AWS went down, I wasn't frozen by stress. I was writing the customer communication. I was checking our retry logic. I was doing what I could do.

The CEO noticed. "You were the calmest person in the room."

Yeah, because I was the only one working on things I could actually fix.

## Not Apathy

This isn't about not caring. It's about directing your care toward things that respond to care.

Code quality responds to care. Test coverage responds to care. Clear communication responds to care.

AWS uptime? Doesn't give a damn what you think about it.

Focus accordingly.
