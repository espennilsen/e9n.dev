# Why I'm Reading 2,000-Year-Old Philosophy for My Tech Career

I'm a sales manager at Lenovo who codes on the side. Last week I was debugging why our internal dashboard was slow, and I could feel the stress building. Then I remembered something Marcus Aurelius wrote.

"You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

It clicked.

## The Problem with Tech Work

Everything in software is either broken or about to break. Dependencies get deprecated. APIs change. Someone else's code breaks your code.

You can spend your entire career stressed about things that are fundamentally out of your control.

Or you can stop.

## The Dichotomy of Control (Applied to Code)

I can't control when a vendor's API goes down. I can control our error handling.

I can't control when requirements change mid-sprint. I can control how I communicate realistic timelines.

I can't control legacy code someone wrote 5 years ago. I can control the new code I write today.

This sounds obvious. But how many times have you refreshed a status page hoping it would magically fix itself?

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Yesterday, a demo I was prepping failed because of an upstream service issue. The old me would have panicked and spent an hour trying to fix something I literally cannot fix.

Instead: I documented the failure, wrote a fallback demo script, and used the extra time to prep better talking points.

The demo went fine. Better than fine, actually, because I was calm and prepared instead of stressed and winging it.

## The Sales Connection

This applies even more in sales. You can't control whether a prospect signs. You can control your research, your pitch, and your follow-up.

The moment I stopped trying to control outcomes and focused on controlling my inputs, my close rate actually went up.

Stoicism isn't about not caring. It's about caring efficiently.

## Reading List

If this resonates, start here:
- **Meditations** by Marcus Aurelius (the OG)
- **The Daily Stoic** by Ryan Holiday (more digestible)

Both are short. Both are practical. Both will change how you think about work stress.

## The Takeaway

Focus on what you can control. Let go of what you can't.

Your code will be better. Your stress will be lower. And ironically, the outcomes you can't control will probably improve too.
