# I Let Copilot Write My Cold Emails for a Month

Here's what I learned: AI makes bad salespeople worse and good salespeople dangerous.

I've been at Lenovo for a while now, managing a team that sells enterprise hardware. Recently, I started experimenting with GitHub Copilot for sales research—yeah, the coding tool. Turns out it's pretty good at drafting cold emails too when you feed it context.

The results surprised me.

<!--excerpt-->

## What Actually Happened

Week 1: Reply rate jumped from 8% to 23%. I felt like I'd discovered a cheat code.

Week 2: Quality of replies tanked. People were responding, sure. But with "not interested" or "remove me from your list."

The AI was good at mimicking personalization. But it wasn't actually personal.

## The Problem With AI-Generated Outreach

Copilot read that a company just raised Series B funding. So it wrote: "Congrats on the Series B! Given your growth trajectory..."

Here's what's wrong with that: Every salesperson and their AI is sending the same "congrats on the Series B" email.

The noise got louder, not clearer.

## Where AI Actually Helps

Research. Oh my god, the research.

I use Copilot to analyze a company's recent blog posts, LinkedIn activity, and tech stack. It gives me a summary in 30 seconds that would've taken me an hour of manual digging.

But the email? I write that myself now.

Because AI can tell me WHAT to know. But it can't tell me HOW to care.

## The New Playbook

My SDRs now spend 80% of their time on calls and relationship-building. AI handles the grunt work:
- Summarizing annual reports
- Tracking account changes
- Scoring leads based on buying signals
- Drafting first-pass research briefs

But the human touch? That's where we win deals.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

AI won't replace salespeople. But salespeople who think they can use AI to avoid doing the hard work of genuinely understanding their customers? They're toast.

The bar just got higher. AI made the basics table stakes. Now you have to actually be good at the human part.

## What I'm Doing Now

Using AI to compress the research phase from hours to minutes. Then spending those saved hours actually talking to people.

The companies that figure this out first? They're going to clean up.

The ones that use AI to send more spray-and-pray emails? They're going to get filtered even harder than before.
