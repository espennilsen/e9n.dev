I have a complicated relationship with LinkedIn.

I check it daily. I post regularly. I've made genuine professional connections there. Some of those connections have led to real opportunities, conversations, and friendships.

And yet. Every time I open the app, I feel a small sense of dread. I scroll past humble brags disguised as vulnerability. I see engagement bait that insults my intelligence. I watch thoughtful posts get buried while "I got fired and it was the best thing that ever happened to me" goes viral.

LinkedIn is broken. But I keep using it. Let me explain both sides.

## What's Broken

**The algorithm rewards performance over substance.** The posts that get reach aren't necessarily the posts that are useful or true. They're the posts that generate engagement. And what generates engagement? Controversy. Emotion. Stories with neat narrative arcs. Hot takes. Vulnerability that's just vulnerable enough to be relatable but not so vulnerable that it makes people uncomfortable.

Thoughtful analysis of a complex topic? Buried. "I disagree" followed by something obvious? Hundreds of comments.

**The culture has become performative.** There's a specific LinkedIn voice that's emerged. Short sentences. Line breaks after every thought. Starting posts with a hook designed to stop the scroll. Ending with a question to drive comments. "Agree?" as a closing.

It works. That's the problem. It works, so everyone does it, so the feed becomes a wall of people performing authenticity in identical ways. The format has consumed the content.

**Engagement pods and gaming are everywhere.** Some of the people with the biggest reach have systematically gamed the algorithm. Pods of people who like and comment on each other's posts to trigger distribution. Posting at optimal times. Editing posts after they're live to avoid algorithm penalties. It's an entire subculture of people treating LinkedIn like a video game to be optimized.

Meanwhile, someone sharing genuine expertise in a niche area gets 47 impressions.

**The incentives are backwards.** LinkedIn rewards consistency and volume over quality. Post every day, even if you have nothing to say, because the algorithm favors regular posters. The result is a lot of people posting a lot of nothing. Recycled insights. Obvious advice. Content created to feed the machine rather than to communicate something worth saying.

**"Thought leadership" has become meaningless.** Everyone's a thought leader now. Everyone has frameworks. Everyone wants to share "what they've learned." Most of it is repackaged common sense or worse, repackaged content from someone else who repackaged it from someone else. The signal to noise ratio is brutal.

**The comments are often worse than the posts.** "Great post, [Name]! Really resonates." "This is so true!" "Following for more insights." These aren't conversations. They're engagement tokens exchanged in hopes of visibility. Genuine discussion gets drowned in performative agreement.

## Why I Stay

So why am I still there? Why do I post? Why do I scroll?

**Because my customers are there.** I work in enterprise sales. The people I sell to are on LinkedIn. They post, they read, they lurk. Being visible on the platform is part of being present in my professional ecosystem. Disappearing would mean becoming invisible to people I need to stay connected with.

**Because some of the connections are real.** Not all of them. But some. I've had DM conversations that turned into calls that turned into relationships that mattered. The platform facilitates introductions that wouldn't happen otherwise. The fact that most interactions are shallow doesn't mean all of them are.

**Because it's distribution I don't have to build.** If I want people to read my blog, I need to drive traffic somehow. LinkedIn gives me access to a network. It's not perfect, but it's there. Building an audience from zero with no distribution is genuinely hard. LinkedIn provides a starting point, even if it's a frustrating one.

**Because visibility compounds.** When I post something that resonates, people remember. Not everyone. But some. Over time, that builds a kind of ambient awareness. People know what I'm interested in, what I'm working on, what I think about. That ambient awareness occasionally turns into something concrete.

**Because the alternative is ceding the territory.** If everyone thoughtful leaves LinkedIn because it's broken, all that's left is the engagement farmers and the humble braggers. I'd rather be one more voice trying to post something genuine than leave the whole space to people optimizing for likes.

## How I Try to Use It Without Losing My Mind

I've developed some guidelines for myself. They help me get value from the platform without getting consumed by its worst tendencies.

**I write for myself first.** If I'm posting something just because I think it will perform well, I don't post it. The goal is to share things I genuinely think or have learned. If it gets reach, great. If not, at least I said something real.

**I don't check metrics obsessively.** I post and move on. Refreshing to see how many likes something got is a trap. The numbers don't mean that much, and optimizing for them changes what you write in ways that aren't good.

**I engage genuinely or not at all.** If I comment, I try to say something substantive. If I don't have anything to add, I don't leave a performative "Great post!" Just because everyone else does it doesn't mean I have to.

**I curate aggressively.** Unfollow liberally. Mute the engagement farmers. Hide the posts that make you want to throw your phone. The algorithm shows you more of what you engage with. Engage with garbage, get more garbage.

**I remember that the feed isn't reality.** The people performing success on LinkedIn are not necessarily successful. The confidence people project is not necessarily real. It's a highlight reel, heavily edited, optimized for perception. Taking it too seriously is a mistake.

**I keep my real writing elsewhere.** LinkedIn gets short posts, quick thoughts, links to longer work. The substantive writing goes on my blog, where I control the format and the content isn't subject to algorithmic whims. LinkedIn is distribution. The blog is home.

## The Uncomfortable Middle Ground

I think a lot of people feel what I feel. They know LinkedIn has problems. They cringe at the culture. They wish it were different. But they also recognize that it has value they can't easily replace.

So they stay, but they feel weird about it. They participate, but they roll their eyes. They post, but they're slightly embarrassed about it.

I've decided to just be honest about this tension instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

LinkedIn is broken. The incentives are misaligned. The culture rewards the wrong things. Much of what gets celebrated is not actually good.

And also: it's where professional conversations happen at scale. It's where my network lives. It's where visibility translates into opportunity. Opting out entirely has real costs.

Both things are true. I can hold them at the same time.

## What Would Make It Better

If I could change LinkedIn, I'd want a few things.

Less algorithmic manipulation. Show me posts from people I follow, in something like chronological order. Let me decide what's interesting instead of having an algorithm decide for me based on engagement metrics that reward the worst content.

Fewer incentives for volume. Stop rewarding people for posting every day regardless of whether they have anything to say. Quality should matter more than consistency.

Better tools for finding substance. Let me filter by topic, by depth, by something other than "what's getting engagement right now." Help me find the people sharing genuine expertise in areas I care about.

A culture shift I can't force. Less performance. More substance. People sharing real thinking instead of optimized content. I don't know how to make this happen. It would require collective behavior change that platforms can't really mandate.

I'm not holding my breath.

## The Bottom Line

LinkedIn is like a networking event where half the people are trying to sell you something, a quarter are performing success for an invisible audience, and maybe a quarter are actually interesting to talk to.

You go anyway because that's where the people are. You learn to filter. You find the interesting quarter. You ignore the rest.

It's not ideal. It's what we've got.

So yes, LinkedIn is broken. And yes, I'll be there tomorrow, posting something and hoping it reaches the people who might actually care.

If you're one of those people, feel free to connect. I promise not to leave a comment that just says "Great post!"
