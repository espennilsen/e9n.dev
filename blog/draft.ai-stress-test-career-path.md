AI can act like a patient strategy partner for your career, but only if you bring clarity about who you are and what you want. Instead of asking "What job should I do?", you get better results by walking through three stages: values clarification, skills mapping, and what-if scenario testing.

## 1. Start with Your Values

Most people skip values work and jump straight to job titles, which is why their AI outputs feel generic. A simple way to fix this is to write a short values snapshot and then let AI pressure-test and refine it.

Start by listing what you think your top values are: autonomy, impact, learning, stability, status, creativity, flexibility, income, etc. Then paste something like this into your AI tool:

> I want to use you as a career coach to clarify my work values. Based on your questions, help me surface the 5-7 values that actually drive my decisions, not just the ones that sound good. Ask me one question at a time about past moments when I felt energized, proud, or frustrated at work. After we've explored a few examples, propose a draft list of my core values with short descriptions for each.

Answer the questions honestly, then ask:

> Using my answers, refine a list of my top work values. For each value, add:
> - How it shows up when things are going well
> - What it looks like when it's missing
> - 1-2 questions I can use as a quick values check before making a big career choice

This gives you a values map you can reuse in every later step, and it anchors all the what-if scenarios in what actually matters to you.

**Example output:**

> Based on our conversation, here are your core work values:
>
> 1. **Autonomy** — You need freedom to structure your own time and approach. When this is missing, you feel micromanaged and constrained by rigid processes.
>
> 2. **Impact** — You want to see direct results from your work. Bureaucracy and initiatives that go nowhere drain your energy quickly.
>
> 3. **Learning** — Continuous growth matters to you. Repetitive work and stagnation are major red flags.
>
> 4. **Financial upside** — You want compensation tied to performance. Capped earnings feel like a ceiling on your potential.
>
> 5. **Relationships** — You thrive when working with people you respect. Toxic cultures and transactional interactions are dealbreakers.

## 2. Map Your Skills and Options

Once your values are clearer, AI can help you see your skills as clusters that point to multiple possible paths instead of a single job title. Start by pasting a short background: your roles, responsibilities, favorite tasks, and things people usually ask you for help with.

Then use a prompt like:

> Act as a career strategist. Here is my background (roles, skills, projects):
> [paste your summary or resume text]
>
> Here are the values we identified earlier:
> [paste your values list]
>
> 1. Group my skills into 3-5 skill clusters (for example: technical execution, stakeholder management, teaching/mentoring, analysis, etc.)
> 2. For each cluster, suggest 3-5 concrete roles or career directions where that cluster is a major strength
> 3. For each suggested role, briefly explain how it fits (or conflicts) with my values

You will likely get a mix of obvious and non-obvious ideas. To push beyond the usual suspects, follow up with:

> Now ignore traditional job titles for a moment. Based on my skills and values, suggest 5 unconventional or hybrid career paths that are emerging or niche but realistic for someone like me within 3-5 years.
>
> For each, give:
> - A 2-3 sentence description of what the work actually looks like day to day
> - Why it might be energizing and where it might clash with my values
> - 1-2 concrete next steps I could take in the next 3 months to test this path with minimal risk

This turns AI into a brainstorming engine that still respects your constraints, instead of a random job title generator.

**Example output:**

> I've grouped your skills into five clusters:
>
> 1. **Consultative selling** — Discovery, needs analysis, solution mapping, navigating complex deals
> 2. **Technical translation** — Bridging engineering and business, explaining complex concepts simply
> 3. **Relationship building** — Trust development, stakeholder management, long-term account growth
> 4. **Strategy and planning** — Territory planning, account prioritization, pipeline management
> 5. **Content and communication** — Writing, presenting, creating materials that resonate
>
> Your consultative selling and technical translation clusters point toward roles like solutions consulting, sales engineering leadership, or customer success for technical products. Your content and communication cluster suggests potential in sales enablement, product marketing, or even building a professional brand through writing.

## 3. Run What-If Scenarios and Risk Checks

Once you have candidate paths, you can ask AI to simulate alternate futures and highlight the tradeoffs and risks of each option. The goal is not to predict the future, but to expose assumptions you might be ignoring.

Pick 2-3 directions you actually want to compare (for example: stay and push for promotion, switch companies into a similar role, pivot into a related discipline). Then prompt:

> I want to stress-test three possible career paths over the next 5 years:
> 1. [Path A]
> 2. [Path B]
> 3. [Path C]
>
> Using the values and skills we discussed, compare these options along:
> - Day-to-day work (what I actually do)
> - Learning and growth
> - Financial upside
> - Lifestyle (hours, flexibility, location)
>
> Then, for each path, describe:
> - Best-case scenario in 5 years
> - Most realistic scenario
> - Worst-case scenario and main risks
>
> Finally, suggest one low-risk experiment I can run in the next 30-60 days to gather real data about which path fits me better.

If you are specifically worried about automation or market shifts, add a risk-focused prompt:

> Looking at my current role and the 2-3 alternative paths we discussed, assess how exposed each one is to automation and AI over the next 5-10 years.
>
> Explain which tasks are most vulnerable, which parts are sticky because they require human judgment or relationships, and which new skills would make me more resilient.
>
> Prioritize 5-7 skills that would reduce my overall career risk while still aligning with my values.

This gives you a simple risk map plus a targeted upskilling list, instead of vague anxiety about AI taking jobs.

**Example output:**

> Here's how your three paths compare:
>
> **Path A: Stay and push for promotion**
> - Day-to-day: Larger deals, more strategic accounts, some team leadership
> - Learning: Leadership skills, executive relationships
> - Financial upside: Higher base, larger deal commissions
> - Lifestyle: Similar hours, established processes
> - Values fit: Strong on financial and relationships, moderate on autonomy
>
> **Path B: Move to a startup**
> - Day-to-day: Smaller team, broader scope, more chaos, build from scratch
> - Learning: Startup operations, wearing many hats
> - Financial upside: Equity potential, lower base, higher risk
> - Lifestyle: Longer hours, more uncertainty
> - Values fit: Strong on autonomy and learning, weaker on stability
>
> **Path C: Pivot to sales enablement**
> - Day-to-day: Training, content creation, process design, less direct selling
> - Learning: Instructional design, scaling knowledge
> - Financial upside: More stable, likely lower ceiling
> - Lifestyle: More predictable, fewer quarter-end crunches
> - Values fit: Strong on impact and relationships, weaker on financial upside
>
> Path A is lowest risk but may not satisfy your learning value long-term. Path B is highest risk but aligns strongly with autonomy and learning. Path C is a pivot that trades financial upside for lifestyle and impact.

## 4. Turn Insights into a Concrete Plan

The last step is to force everything back into action. AI is good at summarizing and prioritizing if you ask with a tight constraint. After a few back-and-forths, close with:

> Based on everything we've discussed (my values, skills, possible paths, scenarios, and risks), do three things:
>
> 1. Write a 1-paragraph career thesis that explains what I'm optimizing for over the next 3-5 years
> 2. List my top 3 bets (specific paths or roles) that fit this thesis best
> 3. For the next 90 days, propose a simple plan with:
>    - One learning goal
>    - One project or experiment
>    - One networking or conversation goal
>
> Make it realistic alongside a full-time job.

Drop that 90-day plan into your notes or task system and revisit it with AI when you hit decision points or new opportunities.

**Example output:**

> **Your career thesis:**
>
> Over the next 3-5 years, you're optimizing for roles that combine strategic selling with some form of leadership or teaching, where compensation is tied to results and you have autonomy in how you work. You want to stay close to customers and avoid purely administrative roles.
>
> **Your top three bets:**
> 1. Sales management at your current company (most likely path, leverages existing relationships)
> 2. Senior IC role at a high-growth startup (higher risk, higher learning potential)
> 3. Player-coach role that combines selling with enablement (emerging hybrid path worth exploring)
>
> **For the next 90 days, here's what I recommend:**
>
> 1. **Learning goal:** Complete one course on sales leadership or coaching skills to test whether the management path energizes you.
>
> 2. **Project/experiment:** Volunteer to lead a deal review or mentor a junior rep. This is a low-risk way to see if leadership work fits before committing to it.
>
> 3. **Networking goal:** Have 3 conversations with people in sales enablement roles. You're curious about Path C but don't have firsthand knowledge of what the work actually looks like day to day. These conversations will give you real data.
>
> Let's revisit after you've completed these experiments.

## The Point

Using AI to stress-test your career path is less about predicting a perfect future and more about running structured experiments that line up with your values, skills, and risk appetite.

The prompts above give you a repeatable process. Use them when you're feeling stuck, facing a decision, or just want to pressure-test whether you're heading in the right direction.
