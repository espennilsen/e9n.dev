I used to think ABC was nonsense. Alec Baldwin yelling at salespeople in Glengarry Glen Ross, all that "coffee is for closers" stuff. It felt like a relic from an era of high-pressure tactics that doesn't work anymore.

Then I realized I'd misunderstood what closing actually means.

ABC isn't about hammering customers until they sign. It's about making sure every conversation moves the deal forward. You're not closing the sale every time you talk to someone. You're closing for the next step. A meeting. Access to another stakeholder. Agreement on timeline. Something concrete.

Once I started thinking about it that way, my pipeline got a lot healthier.

## Deals Die from Neglect

Here's what happens without the ABC mindset. You have a great discovery call. Customer seems interested, asks good questions, says all the right things. You hang up feeling good. Then you send a follow-up email and... nothing. Two weeks later you're still "waiting to hear back."

I've had deals sit in my pipeline for months like this. Looking back, the problem was always the same: I left conversations without nailing down what happens next. The customer and I both walked away with vague intentions but no commitment.

ABC fixes this. It forces you to ask yourself after every interaction: what did I actually close? Not the deal. But something. If the answer is nothing, you just had a nice chat. Nice chats don't pay the bills.

## What Closing Looks Like at Each Stage

The word "close" trips people up because they think it only means getting a signature. But you're closing throughout the entire sales cycle. The object of the close just changes.

### When You're Prospecting

At this stage, you're not selling your product. You're selling a meeting. That's it.

I've made the mistake of ending prospecting calls with "let me know if you'd like to connect." That's not a close. That's handing control to someone who has a hundred other things competing for their attention.

What works better: "It sounds like this is worth a longer conversation. Do you have 30 minutes Thursday afternoon? I'll send a calendar invite."

Specific day. Specific time. Calendar invite. Now it's real.

The small thing you're closing for is a meeting on the calendar. Without that, you don't have a prospect. You have a maybe.

### During Discovery

Discovery is where you're learning about their problems, their process, who's involved in decisions. But you're not just gathering information passively. You're earning the right to go deeper.

The closes during discovery are things like:

Getting access to other people. "You mentioned Sarah deals with this problem daily. Would it help to bring her into our next conversation?"

Confirming your understanding. "So the main issue is that your current system can't handle the performance requirements for the AI workloads you're planning. Is that right?"

Locking in a follow-up. "I want to dig into the technical requirements with your infrastructure team. Can we set up a session for next week?"

I've had discovery calls where I learned a ton but walked away without any commitment for what happens next. Those deals almost always stalled. The customer wasn't being evasive. I just didn't ask.

### When You Present Your Solution

Demos and presentations are where a lot of salespeople relax. You've done the discovery, you know what they need, now you just show them the goods. But this is actually a critical moment to close.

What you're closing for is validation. Does what I've shown actually address the problem? Are there gaps? What concerns do you have?

The worst thing you can do is finish a demo with "so, any questions?" and get a polite "no, that was great, thanks." That tells you nothing.

Better: "Based on what I've shown, does this approach solve the latency issues you described?" Now they have to engage with whether your solution actually fits.

And before you end: "If this looks like a fit, what's the logical next step on your end?" Don't assume. Ask.

### Negotiation and Proposal

This is the stage everyone associates with closing, and honestly, it's the most straightforward. You've done the work. Now you need to get to a decision.

The closes here are direct:

"Can you commit to reviewing the proposal by Friday so we can address any questions next week?"

"What else do you need to make a decision?"

"Is there anything standing between us and getting this signed?"

I used to be squeamish about asking these questions. It felt pushy. But I've learned that customers actually appreciate directness. They're busy. They have their own processes to manage. A salesperson who's clear about what needs to happen is easier to work with than one who dances around.

The thing I always try to close for at this stage is a specific date. When will you review this? When does legal need to see it? When can we expect a decision? Dates create accountability.

### After They Sign

ABC doesn't stop when the contract comes back. Post-sale is where you close for references, case studies, and expansion.

Right after signing, when goodwill is highest: "Once we've had a successful implementation, would you be open to being a reference for other companies in your industry?"

A few months in: "You mentioned the team in Europe has similar challenges. Now that you've seen the results here, would it make sense to explore rolling this out to them?"

The best future deals come from customers who are happy. But you still have to close for the expansion. It doesn't happen automatically.

## Why This Works

The ABC mindset works because it creates clarity. For you, because you always know where a deal actually stands. Not where you hope it stands. For the customer, because they know what's expected and what happens next.

It also surfaces problems early. If a customer won't commit to a next step, that's a signal. Maybe they're not that interested. Maybe there's an obstacle you haven't uncovered. Either way, better to know now than to carry a dead deal in your pipeline for three months.

And there's momentum. Deals that move forward tend to keep moving forward. Each small close makes the next one easier. Deals that stall tend to stay stalled.

## What I'm Not Saying

I want to be clear: ABC isn't an excuse to be pushy or manipulative. If your customer isn't ready for the next step, pressuring them doesn't help. It just damages the relationship.

The right move is sometimes to wait. But even then, you close for a specific time to reconnect. "Sounds like January is when this becomes a priority. Let's schedule a call for the second week of January to pick this back up." That's still a close.

ABC also assumes you actually believe your solution helps the customer. If you're trying to close deals that are bad for the buyer, that's a different problem. No mantra fixes that.

## Putting It Into Practice

If you want to try this, start with one habit: never end a conversation without confirming what happens next.

Before you hang up the phone or leave the meeting, make sure you both know the next step and when it's happening. Put it on the calendar if you can. Send a confirmation email right after.

That one change will do more for your pipeline than any closing technique or trick question.

Always be closing. Not for the signature. For progress. Every single time.
