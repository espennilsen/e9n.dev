# Azure Local at Ignite 2025: The AI Revolution On-Premises

Microsoft Ignite 2025 delivered a wave of enterprise AI news and the most substantial updates yet for **Azure Local**—with a clear focus on how AI agentic workloads and large language models (LLMs) are moving closer to the data, at the edge, and inside regulated environments.

If you run or build on Azure Local, here's what you need to know from this week's announcements.

## 🧠 AI on Azure Local: Key Announcements

### Azure AI Foundry Agent Service — Build and Run Agents On-Prem

Azure AI Foundry Agent Service now supports **deploying, orchestrating, and monitoring AI agents locally on Azure Local** infrastructure—not just in public Azure regions. This lets enterprises build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) apps, multi-agent pipelines, and bespoke LLM-powered automation entirely within their controlled, on-prem environment ([Microsoft Tech Community Blog: Foundry Agent Service at Ignite 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-agent-service-at-ignite-2025-simple-to-build-powerful-to-integrate/), [Azure Blog: Intelligent Cloud News Explained](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-at-microsoft-ignite-2025-all-the-intelligent-cloud-news-explained/), [AI, Cloud, and the Unified Agent Platform](https://www.efficientlyconnected.com/ai-cloud-and-the-emergence-of-microsofts-unified-agent-platform/)).

#### Highlights:
- **Bring Your Own Model (BYOM):**
  Deploy open-source models (Llama, Mistral, Stable Diffusion, etc.), custom LLMs, or enterprise-tuned models *locally* for inferencing and automation—with no cloud round-trip or dependency ([Agent Loop Ignite Update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/%F0%9F%93%A2-agent-loop-ignite-update---new-set-of-ai-features-arrive-in-public-preview/), [What's new in Azure AI Foundry](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-2025-whats-new-azure-ai-foundry-more-agents-scientific-gopal-yw4fc/)).
- **Enterprise Data Grounding:**
  Agents running on Azure Local with **Foundry IQ** (preview) can securely access and ground to enterprise knowledge sources—OneLake, SharePoint, Databricks, custom documents—making RAG and Retrieval workflows accessible on-prem ([Microsoft Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-at-microsoft-ignite-2025-all-the-intelligent-cloud-news-explained/)).
- **Unified AgentOps & Observability:**
  New builtin tracing, evaluation, and cost/safety monitoring integrated via Foundry and Azure Arc portals for all local agent and LLM tasks ([Microsoft Tech Community Blog: Foundry Agent Service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-agent-service-at-ignite-2025-simple-to-build-powerful-to-integrate/)).
- **Security & Compliance:**
  Local deployments fully integrate with Microsoft Purview, meaning prompt data protection and operational compliance standards for agentic AI workflows in sensitive environments ([Microsoft Ignite Book of News](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2025-book-of-news/)).

## ⚡️ AI-Native Platform Features

### Massive Scale and Reliability for AI
- **Rack-aware clustering** (preview): Partition clusters along rack boundaries to ensure agent workloads survive hardware failures ([What's new in hyperconverged deployments of Azure Local?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/whats-new?view=azloc-2511), [Tech Community Blog: What's new in Azure Local](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearcblog/what%E2%80%99s-new-in-azure-local-cloud-infrastructure-for-distributed-locations/)).
- **10,000+ core and 100+ node clusters**: Easily scale out your AI training and inferencing workloads for real enterprise or service provider settings ([Tech Community Blog: What's new in Azure Local](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearcblog/what%E2%80%99s-new-in-azure-local-cloud-infrastructure-for-distributed-locations/)).
- **Hot-add memory to VMs**: Grow machine resources for AI tasks without taking them offline ([What's new in hyperconverged deployments of Azure Local?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/whats-new?view=azloc-2511)).

### Developer Velocity
- **Unified SDK for Agents:**
  Develop agents on your laptop/dev box using Microsoft's agent framework (open source SDK with Semantic Kernel + AutoGen), then push seamlessly to run on Azure Local or in cloud with consistent runtime semantics ([AI, Cloud, and the Unified Agent Platform](https://www.efficientlyconnected.com/ai-cloud-and-the-emergence-of-microsofts-unified-agent-platform/), [Agent Loop Ignite Update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/%F0%9F%93%A2-agent-loop-ignite-update---new-set-of-ai-features-arrive-in-public-preview/)).

### Migration & Modernization
- **Azure Migrate Integration:**
  Migrate legacy VMs, data, and workloads to Azure Local seamlessly, with support for agentic and AI-centric workflows, ensuring your infrastructure is ready for the next wave of automation ([Spirhed at Microsoft Ignite 2025: VM Migration to Azure Local](https://spirhed.com/microsoft-ignite-2025-spirhed/)).

## 🚨 Why This Matters

Azure Local isn't just "cloud on your hardware"—it's now an **AI agent and LLM orchestration platform**. AI teams can:
- Keep inferencing *close to the data* for compliance, privacy, and performance.
- Roll out RAG, LLM, and agentic apps in disconnected or regulated sites.
- Use enterprise datasets (SharePoint, OneLake, etc.) for locally grounded answers.
- Monitor and secure AI workflows end-to-end, with full compliance.

**Hybrid cloud is becoming hybrid AI. The Ignite 2025 updates make Azure Local one of the best ways to run advanced agents and LLMs at the edge, in the datacenter, or wherever your mission demands.**
