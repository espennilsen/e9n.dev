# x10s - AI Agent Sandbox

An advanced AI Sandbox environment designed to orchestrate and run parallel autonomous agents. Built with React, TypeScript and PostgreSQL to handle high-performance multi-agent workflows and emergent behaviors.

## Concept

The idea is to create a playground where multiple AI agents can work in parallel, interact with each other, and solve complex tasks through collaboration and specialization.

## Planned Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Run dozens of agents simultaneously
- **Custom Agent Templates** - Define specialized agents for different tasks
- **Inter-Agent Communication** - Agents can share context and coordinate
- **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time metrics and behavior analysis
- **Workflow Persistence** - Save and replay agent interactions

## Tech Stack

Built on a modern stack optimized for real-time performance and scalability.

## Status

Currently in early development. Exploring different agent architectures and communication patterns.
